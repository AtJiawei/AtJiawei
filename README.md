🚀 Welcome to the coding playground of Jiawei Tian! @AtJiawei

✨ "Eureka! Why didn't I discover this gem earlier?!" That's exactly what crossed my mind when I embarked on my first CS courses.

👀 Join me on a thrilling adventure as I craft a maze game in pure C, armed with nothing but the <stdio.h>! 🎮 But hold on tight, because the fun is just getting started! I'm on a quest to level up my coding skills by sprinkling in some magic with libraries like ncurses (recently summoned) and SDL (next in line). 🧙‍♂️✨ Watch as this project transforms from a simple maze to a more entertaining game (hopefully).

🌱 Embrace the philosophy of continuous learning and hands-on experience! 🚀💻
